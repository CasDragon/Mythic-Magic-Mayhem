# Mythic Magic Mayhem
## Our plan for version 1:
### Make all mythic spellbooks mergable with all full caster spellbooks
### Lich adjustments:
- Add lesser animate dead, greater create undead and gloomblind bolts to lich spellbook
- Improve Undead Mount power by adding a CHA bonus to mount equal to mythic rank
- Add a mythic power option to turn a companion's animal companion into undead template
- Add a passive perk at MR5 to use CON or CHA (whichever is highest) for fort and hp modifiers
### Angel adjustments:
- Increase Bolt of Justice to 7th level
- Increase Storm of Justice to 9th level
- Add Improved Angelic Halo - Divine Champion: While Angelic Halo is active energy damage is converted into holy damage
- Add Improved Angelic Halo - Flames of Heaven: While Angelic Halo is active energy damage is converted into fire damage
